## A little about myself

My name's is Andrés. I am a computer programmer who likes to solve problems and improve lives through technology using my brain.
Now I am a newly Computer Science Engineer graduated at Universidad Nacional de Itapua.

I was born and raised in Encarnación, a small city located in the south of Paraguay. 

When I'm not in a <i>nerd mode</i> I try to play basketball, chess or travel somewhere I am able to go.
