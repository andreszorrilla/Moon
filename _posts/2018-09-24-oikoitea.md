In this post I am going to talk about <b>Oikoitea</b>, my Final Project Degree to get my title of Computer Science Engineer at Universidad Nacional de Itapua.

It is an visual agenda built in Django that using Word Embeddings for Image Retrieval.

So, let's start!

<center><b>Oikoitea:</b> Comunication for everyone.</center>

### Etimology
First to all, what does Oikoitea mean?
It derivate from two words
* Oikoite: a word in <i>Guarani</i> that means <u>Everything is OK</u>
* TEA: Acronym in Spanish of <u><b>T</b>ranstorno del <b>E</b>spectro <b>A</b>utista</u>



### So... What is Oikoitea?


Oikoitea is a project that consists in the development of an Visual Agenda Manager, which is basically a sequences of activities that are represented with images, that aims to professionals to communicate with people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (TEA in Spanish).

{: .image-center}
<center><b>Picture 1:</b> Activity set for a Visual Agenda, in this case, steps of how to brush teeth.</center>



In view that currently there are applications like this, it has been proposed the image retrieval by text using <i>Natural Language Processing</i> or NLP considering its respective descriptions attached to the images, looking for improvement in the retrieval taking into acount the semantic variations of the words.

*What is the advantage of this?*

So basicly


### NLP and Word Embeddings

It has been considered a technique of word representation called <b>Word Embeddings</b> that generates a Vector Space Model (VSM). During the textual search, the search term entered and the descriptions stored in the database have been vectorized based on the vocabulary of the VSM, for later comparison according to the cosine similarity metric and returning the results in an order of relevance.

Once the search has been achieved, it has been integrated together with a web application allowing the Management of Visual Agendas. Based on the results obtained, it has been demonstrated that with the proposed application, better results are obtained with respect to semantics than searches based on text labels.



### Architecture

<center><b>Picture 2:</b> Oikoitea's architecture.</center>

In the Picture 2, it has been chosen a client-server architecture as follow: 
* in the client side the users are able to access to the aplication through a browser. 
* in the server side there are the application with the MVT model, database and external process that does not interact with the users, but are essentials to the correct operation of the proposed application, such as:
	* Image load to database
	* translate process
	* data cleaning
	* training and re-training algorithms
	* word to vector conversions
